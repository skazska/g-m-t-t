We would be interested if you could do a little test
task for us, it allows us to judge:

a) How good can you create something from a vague description

b) How good are you in judging how long a task will take you
and finally:

c) Your code

Here is the test:

Create a phonebook which allows to keep peoples names and phones.
It has one page which allows to add, edit and remove entries
via XHR. It also allows to download the phonebook as a text file
(e.g. comma-separated) and also upload a new version.

When it uploads a file, it updates the phonebook, creating,
updating and deleting records as appropriate. In short it
has to sync (not just replace) the web-added data with
the uploaded file.

You are allowed to use rich Javascript packages, but we encourage
you to use newest, stable versions of whatever you will use to solve
this problem.

Please let us know if you accept this challenge and if yes, how
long do you think you need to solve it. Please understand
that this test becomes the showcase of your skills, so don't skip
on professional development and presentation standards
(intentional vague).
